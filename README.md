# Complete Graph Coloring
Bart Massey

This Rust program uses standard methods to try to color a
graph given in DIMACS ASCII format. It is intended primarily
as a learning exercise, and is currently extraordinarily
slow compared to "good" methods.

A tiny sample instance is included for testing purposes. For
DIMACS instances, see
[here](https://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances.html).
